## Chapter 7: IDT and interruptions

An interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention.

There are 3 types of interruptions:

- **Hardware interruptions:** are sent to the processor from an external device (keyboard, mouse, hard disk, ...)
- **Software interruptions:** are initiated voluntarily by the software. It's used to manage system calls.
- **Exceptions:**  are used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself (division by zero, page fault, ...)
