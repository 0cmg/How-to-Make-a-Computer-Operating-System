How to Make a Computer Operating System
=======================================

**Caution**: This repository is a remake of my old course. It was written several years ago [as one of my first projects when I was in High School](https://github.com/SamyPesse/devos) so it's normal if some parts of the code looks like "crap". The original course was in french and I'm not a english native.

**Source Code**: All the system source code will be stored in the **src** directory. Each steps of the course will be linked to a git tag.

### What kind of OS are we building?

The goal is to build a very simple UNIX-based operating system in C++, but the goal is not to build just a "proof-of-concept". The OS sould be able to boot, start an userland shell and be extensible.
